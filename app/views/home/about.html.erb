        Giving Profiles is a simple way to collect all your charitable donations
        in a single place. Use it to keep track of your giving, share your
        favorite charities with friends, and discover great new organizations to
        support. We are a team of researchers from Harvard and Yale who
        specialize in motivating people to do more good. We're not venture
        capitalists, or serial-startup-ists, and we're not here to make a buck.
        We're here to put our research into practice, and see if we can help you
        make the biggest difference you can!
